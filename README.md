renderjson
==========

Render JSON into collapsible HTML. This library aims to be very simple with no options and no external dependencies. It's aimed at debugging but you can use it wherever it is useful.


Example
-------

```
<div id="test">
<script type="text/javascript" src="renderjson.js"></script>
<script>
    document.getElementById("test").appendChild(
        renderjson({ hello: [1,2,3,4], there: { a:1, b:2, c:["hello", null] } });
</script>
```

Usage
-----

The module exports one entry point, the `renderjson()` function. It takes in the JSON you want to render as a single argument and returns an HTML element.
